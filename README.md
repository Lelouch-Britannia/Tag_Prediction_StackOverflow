# **TAG PREDICTION OF STACK OVERFLOW QUESTIONS USING ML ALGORITHMS**

<br/>

### Introduction
Currently, with huge amounts of data present throughout the world, technology is growing at an enormous pace and is accessible to everyone. There is a huge demand for filtering and sorting the data based on a person's need. One such platform, StackOverflow, is a place which is used in finding a solution to Engineer’s daily faced problems which are taken up by a large community of Engineers, students and tech enthusiasts. To ease up this process at both ends, filtering the questions based on requester’s needs is really important, so as to make the process more efficient. We wish to work on this and provide an automatic tag predictor for StackOverflow posts.

* Facebook Recruiting III - Keyword Extraction | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction)
* Predicting tags for StackOverflow | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/miljan/predicting-tags-for-stackoverflow/notebook)
### Content
1. Data Preparation
2. EDA : Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Implementing Algorithms
    * The algorithms used Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, Multi Layer Perceptron, Deep NN, KNN, Multi Label KNN.
4. Tuning and Analysis
    * The algorithms are tuned with the help of different hyperparameters and cross validation techniques. 
    * This lets us gain insight into the bias-variance tradeoff



**Please Note** : The problem of tag classification has been studied fairly rigorously. This was done to systematically apply and analyze some of the methods known to gain an analytical insight of the hands-on implementation of these various techniques.
